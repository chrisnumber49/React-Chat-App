## Reflection 
 
In this side project, I built an application that have the basic functions of a general chat services with the Chat Engine API. I started this project by using the command `create-react-app` to create the boilerplate, then two additional library `axios` and `react-chat-engine` were installed during the development in this project.  

In the `renderChatFeed` props of ChatEngine component, I create a new component file to overwrite and customize the part of the chat feed UI for my own design. Through this project and with the tutorial in Chat Engine website, I learned about how the chat engine API works and how to use it to create a functional direct-messaging application.
